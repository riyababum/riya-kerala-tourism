            <p>
              Kasaragod, the northernmost district of Kerala, is blessed with Nature's bounty, owing to the mighty stretches of Western Ghats to the east, the Arabian Sea to the west, 12 rivers and many streams crisscrossing the land.
              
              Many Arab travellers came to Kerala between the 9th and 14th centuries. The Malik Dinar Mosque, the Bela church, the Jain Bastis and the various ancient temples in the area speak volumes for the cultural interaction that the land facilitated between the natives and the foreigners.
            
              To its south is the Kannur District renowned for its ritual arts like Theyyam. Dakshina Kannada district of Karnataka known for its Yakshagana dance forms the northern boundary.  The mighty Western Ghats forms a wall along the eastern side. The western side is eternally caressed by the supple hands of Arabian Sea. 
              he northernmost district of Kerala, Kasaragod is world renowned for its coir and handloom industries. Fishing is a prime source of livelihood. Kasaragod is known as the land of gods, forts, rivers, hills and beautiful beaches. The fort at Bekal is the largest and best preserved in the State. 

              Kasaragod displays a variety of styles in temple architecture - the unique style of the Madhur Mahaganapathy Temple, the typical Kerala style of the historic Malik Deenar Great Juma Masjid and so on speak volumes about the rich cultural heritage of the region.
