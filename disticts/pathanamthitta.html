            <h2>About</h2>
            <br><br>
            <p>A hilly province of pristine splendour, the district of Pathanamthitta is hailed as the headquarters of pilgrim worship in Kerala. Three rivers course through its prosperous terrains comprising natural divisions of the lowlands, the midlands and the highlands. Interspersed with temples, rivers, mountain ranges and coconut groves, more than fifty per cent of the total area of this region is covered by forests.

                Pathanamthitta has been dubbed a Heritage Village as it attracts visitors from all over the world for its spectacular water fiestas, religious shrines and cultural training centres. Pathanamthitta is also home to the unique AranmulaKannadi - metal mirrors that are meticulously handcrafted and the VasthuVidyaGurukulam, a village which practices the ancient Indian school of architecture.

                The smallest of Kerala districts, situated in the southern region of Kerala, Pathanamthitta has nearly half of its total area under forest cover. It is the pilgrim center of Kerala, renowned for the shrine of Lord Ayappa in the Sabari Hills, drawing millions of devotees from near and far off places. The district also is known as a center for experiencing and learning some of the cultural as well as traditional practices of Kerala. Kollam, Kottayam and Alappuzha form the adjoining districts of Pathanamthitta. </p>
